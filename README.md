## PART1
### 《ANIMA》 (2014) is an interactive installation by artist Nick verstand that explores the emotional relationship between humans and man-made entities through the use of movement, texture, light and sound.

### Spherical images emanate from within the object,Inside the artwork is a artistic effects programme，a projector containing a hemispherical camera inside gives the image a distorting effect. The image is finally projected on a transparent Spherical curtain with a special material.This piece heals the viewer's psyche through abstract sound and light effects.

# PART2

### I was inspired by this work of art, I want to use P5.js to create a circle with the centre of the circle as the axis, and constantly change the effect on the fly, and through this effect to create my work, so that the work can produce an artistic effect that will never be repeated. Through this work, I hope to achieve the effect of relieving the viewer's psychological pressure.
